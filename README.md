# 3-2-1 Android! 

Wanna build a native Android app, but aren't sure where to begin? No problem, I've got you covered! In this workshop, I'll get you up and running with a simple Android app and in the process you'll learn the basics of Android development. You'll learn how to define views and the activities behind them, how to implement gestures, icons, menus and more! You'll leave the session with enough Android development experience that'll enable you to create the next killer app! 

## Requirements

You'll need to [download the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) for your platform (i.e. OSX, Windows, etc). Included in the SDK is a version of Eclipse containing the Android Development Toolkit (or ADT), which you can use for this workshop.
