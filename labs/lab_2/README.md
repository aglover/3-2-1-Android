# Lab #2

In this lab, you'll be able to get a close up view of Android `Activity`s, layouts, and gestures. Your job is to make this app work. That is, read the code & corresponding comments closely. You'll only need to focus on the `OverheardWord` class. But do take some time to look over its base class: `DefaultActivity` as that'll help you ascertain an `Activity`s life-cycle.
