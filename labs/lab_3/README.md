# Lab #3

In this lab, you'll deploy a working version of the app you previously saw in lab #2 to a device. Hopefully you brought a device! 

Then, you'll go through the process of signing an app -- this is an important step as without it, you cannot submit your app to Google Play or Amazon's Android App store.
